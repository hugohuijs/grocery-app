						<p>I found myself often eating the same meals and requiring the same old items from the grocery store, week in and week out.</p>
						<p>In that light, I thought it to be useful to have an app that allows me to simply select these dishes and items to make a quick grocery list.</p>
						<p>This app let's you select which dishes you want to eat during the week, how many people will join for dinner on specific days and which other items you might need during the week.</p>
						<p>It then extracts the ingredients of the selected dishes and orders them based on ingredient type, after which you can download a convenient checklist to be used during the grocery haul.</p>

						<p>At Orikami, the business development team was looking for a landing page to accelerate lead generation.</p>
						<p>In that context, I wanted to create this page myself, potentially allowing us to avoid subscription costs from template services.</p>
						<p>This page displays the services that Orikami offers and aims to mimic the style of <a style="color: black;text-decoration:underline;font-weight:bold" href="https://www.orikami.ai">Orikami's</a> official website.</p>
